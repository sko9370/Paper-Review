- Paper Title: An Analysis of China's "Great Cannon"
- Author: Bill Marczak; Nicholas Weaver; Jakub Dalek; Roya Ensafi

### Did you like this paper?  Why?
- Yes, the paper described the variety of information the researchers gained by using relatively simple tools.
They didn't use complicated techniques, rather, they took the data they were able to get and were able to logically conclude very important pieces of information about China's Great Cannon.
The paper also compares and contrasts the Great Cannon with the Great Firewall.

### What problem is this paper solving?
- This paper is solving the mystery of China's Great Cannon.
Not much is known about this private government tool, especially its capabilities and functions.
The authors are able to generally locate the system and describe its basic functions while differentiating it from the Great Firewall.

### What are the strengths of this paper?
- The strengths of this paper are that it divides up each piece of information up into short digestible sections.
There is good partitioning between topics, almost as if I didn't need to know about GreatFire.org's Logs to the history of the GC.
There is also a variety of articles cited where the authors are able to come to conclusions using pieces of information gleaned from events or incidents in combination with the results of their tests with the Chinese network.

### What are the main weaknesses in the paper?
- The main weakness of this paper is perhaps the exploration of the ethical aspect of China's Great Cannon and Firewall.
I think the section about implications of China's control of the internet could have been expanded to include the people's opinions on what they think about the censorship and their internet traffic being rerouted.
I also found the diagram comparing the GC and Great Firewall to be a bit confusing at first because the arrows from the main route of traffic implied that the rerouted traffic and tapped traffic were similar processes.
Without having carefully understood the functions of the GC and GF, Figure 1 may have been a bit misleading.

### Next Steps?
- I would be curious to know of different ways people have tried to combat the GC so that their traffic wouldn't automatically be rerouted.
Along the same line of thought, I would like to know how futureproof the GC is.
Will the GC be outsmarted within 5 years? Exploited and used against the Chinese Government in 10 years?
Similar (if any) cases of states using their power to manage internet traffic would be an interesting extension to the paper.
They may not be as infamous as China's Great Wall or Cannon, but they may provide a greater perspective on the use of tools by states in attempting to control information.


## How to Read a Paper

### 1. Category
- This paper is a explanation of the functionality and abilities of China's Great Cannon.

### 2. Context
- The paper begins with an explanation of the Great Firewall and begins to describe differences with the Great Cannon. This sets up basic knowledge and adds in details about what's unique to the GC.

### 3. Correctness
- Much of the information cannot be officially verified because of the nature of the research.
However, the authors seemed to use good logical flow in their presentation of theories and ideas with evidence.

### 4. Contributions
- The paper contributed to a greater understanding of the capabilities of China's Great Cannon against web servers that go against the political will of its government.

### 5. Clarity
- The paper is well written.
There is no fluff and each section gets to the point of what it's trying to explain with adequate context, detailed description of the steps taken, and an analysis of the results.
